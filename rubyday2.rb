# Object Oriented Car Challenge

# Story: As a programmer, I can make a vehicle.
# Task: Create a class called Vehicle
class Vehicle
  # Story: As a programmer, I can turn on and off the lights on a given vehicle.
  # Task: Create method(s) to allow programmer to turn lights on and off.
  # Story: As a programmer, I can determine if the lights are on or off. Lights start in the off position.
  # Tests:
  # vehicle = Vehicle.new(...)
  # vehicle.lightsOn? # should return false
  # vehicle.lightsOn = true
  # vehicle.lightsOn? # should return true
  # vehicle.lightsOn = false
  # vehicle.lightsOn? # should return false
